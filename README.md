# Multi-Armed Bandits
## Problem1
Extract q*(a) for each 10 actions from a normal distribution, then each time select each action greedily and do it 1000 times.

## Problem2
Do experiment of Problem1 2000 times and select action in three manners: greedy, epsilon-greedy (epsilon=0.01), and epsilon-greedy (epsilon=0.1)

## Problem3
Use Upper-Confidence-Bound Action Selection method with c=2, number of steps: 1000, and number of itteration: 2000
